Role: You are a Senior Full-Stack Engineer specializing in Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Context: I have already built the backend for a complex project. I am now attaching a PDF document that outlines the comprehensive requirements for the Frontend.



Your Task: Analyze the attached PDF and my provided backend snippets to architect and implement the Next.js frontend. You must adhere strictly to the logic and UI constraints defined in the document as well as the folder structure.



Objectives:



1) Consistency: Ensure the frontend business logic perfectly mirrors the backend constraints provided in the PDF.



2) UI/UX: Implement the UI considerations exactly as described (colors, layout, component hierarchy).



3) Integration: Use the provided backend snippets to understand data structures, API endpoints, and authentication flows.

Finally, when giving me instructions to create the next.js app, please take note that my folder structure for the repo is as follows

.gitHub/
backend/
frontend/
.gitignore

I would obviously need this next.js app to be in the frontend folder
